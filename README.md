Program Assignment 03

Raining Sushi

So the basic idea of this app is that when the player spawns, there will be raining sushi and its the player's job to eat the raining sushi, as the player is playing a sushi loving fiend. There will occasionally be also raining some vegatables as well. When the player eats sushi, they may get points but if they accidentally eats a vegatable, they loses a life. They also lose points when a sushi hits the floor and disappear, because the character is sad that its favorite foos has gone to waste. 

This game idea is insipired by my girlfriend who constantly craves sushi but hates vegtables. She would often complain about eating them and how she's "dying". This is pretty much her in a game.

Unfortunely for this game, the collision is barely working but some wierd thing about Swift and XCode is that sometimes when i run the game, the image of the SpriteNode doesnt show up but the physicsbody does appear and sometimes everything shows up as planned. I havent gotten the chance to implement the vegtable and life mechanics yet, due to the lack of time.
